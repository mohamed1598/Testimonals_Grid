                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp,I've never written a line of code.I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged of theirs who can only sat wonderful things who can only say wonderful things about the program.The entire curriculum and staff didnot disappoint.They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.The agile team project,in particular,was outstanding.It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.In fact,I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my develpent experience.It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.100% recommended"</p>
